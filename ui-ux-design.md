STADI UI/UX Design Specification
STADI‚Äôs UI/UX is crafted to deliver a sophisticated, eloquent, and undeniably appealing experience that rivals the best mobile apps (e.g., Instagram, Uber, OpenSea). The design prioritizes visual elegance, intuitive navigation, and fan-centric engagement, ensuring seamless interaction across event discovery, ticket trading, STADI Pods, rewards, food concierge, and community features. The app-like experience is anchored by a bottom navigation bar on mobile, with a modern, vibrant aesthetic powered by React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
üé® Design Principles

Fan-Centric Hype: Every screen exudes energy, reflecting the excitement of live events with bold visuals, dynamic animations, and gamified rewards (e.g., drops, leaderboards).
Sleek Minimalism: Clean layouts, ample whitespace, and purposeful color accents ensure a premium, uncluttered feel.
Intuitive Flow: One-tap access to core actions (e.g., join event, claim drop, order food) with predictable navigation patterns.
App-Like Immersion: Smooth transitions, micro-animations, and a fixed bottom nav create a native app feel in the browser.
Accessibility: WCAG-compliant (contrast, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) to ensure inclusivity for all fans.
Scalability: Modular components and responsive design adapt seamlessly from mobile to desktop.
